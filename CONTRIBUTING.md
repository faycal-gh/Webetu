##  Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

### Backend

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 (LTS) or higher.
- **Maven**: Version 3.8+.
- **Docker**: For containerization testing.

### Frontend

- **Node.js**: Version 18.17.0 (LTS) or higher.
- **Package Manager**: `pnpm` (Corepack enabled) or `npm`.
---

##  Project Architecture

Please familiarize yourself with the project structure before making changes:

- **`backend/`**: Spring Boot 3.x application following a layered architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repository).
- **`frontend/`**: Next.js 14+ application using the App Router and TypeScript.
- **`infrastructure/`**: (If applicable) Docker Compose and deployment configurations.

Refer to the main `README.md` for detailed architectural diagrams.

###  Specialties & Universities

The recommendation engine relies on community-contributed data. To add or update universities and specialties, please refer to the [Specialties Contribution Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING_SPECIALTIES.md).

##  Development Workflow

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/progress-rebuild.git
   cd progress-rebuild
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   - **Backend**: 
     - Copy `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml.example` to `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` (if not using env vars).
     - Or set environment variables like `JWT_SECRET` and `GROQ_API_KEY`.
   - **Frontend**: Create a `.env.local` file based on the provided template.

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   mvn clean install

   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

##  Branching Strategy

We follow a strict **Git Flow** variant:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code. Locked.
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for the next release.
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/ticket-ID-description` (e.g., `feature/AUTH-01-login-page`)
- **Bugfix Branches**: `fix/ticket-ID-description`
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/critical-issue`

**Naming Convention:**

- Use lowercase with hyphens.
- Include the Jira/Issue ID if applicable.

---

##  Code Standards

### Backend (Java/Spring Boot)

- **Style**: Follow Google Java Style Guide.
- **Architecture**:
  - DTOs for all API inputs/outputs (Never expose Entities directly).
  - Constructor Injection for dependencies (`@RequiredArgsConstructor`).
  - Validation annotations (`@Valid`, `@NotNull`) on DTOs.
- **Testing**:
  - Integration tests for Controllers.
  - Unit tests for Services.
  - Minimum 80% code coverage.

### Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)

- **Style**: Prettier + ESLint configuration must pass.
- **Components**:
  - Use Functional Components with Typed Props.
  - Separate logic into custom hooks (`useAuth`).
  - Use `clsx` or `tailwind-merge` for class manipulation.
- **State Management**: Prefer Server Components for data fetching; use Context only when necessary.
- **Types**: No `any`. Define interfaces for all data structures.

##  Pull Request Process

1. **Self-Review**: Ensure your code builds locally and all tests pass.
2. **Sync**: Rebase your branch onto `develop` to resolve conflicts (`git pull --rebase origin develop`).
3. **Open PR**: Target the `develop` branch.
4. **Description**:
   - Link the related issue.
   - Describe the changes and the _why_ behind them.
   - Attach screenshots/videos for UI changes.
5. **CI Checks**: Wait for CI pipelines (Build, Test, OWASP Scan) to pass.
6. **Review**: Address comments from reviewers. Two approvals are required for merge.

---

##  Reporting Issues

- **Security**: Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Email [security@yourdomain.com] directly.
- **Bugs**: Use the Bug Report template. Include reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and logs.
- **Features**: Use the Feature Request template to propose new functionality.
